:title: Computer vision with Python

In this presentation I will show you how you can use Python for
computer vision. This will be done with different examples. First I
will start with a short introduction into computer vision. After that
I will show a short example of transfer learning where I let a
computer recognize the difference between a Sedan and and a SUV. Next,
I will talk about one of the projects the data science team at the
university of Groningen is working on. In this project we have to
recognize budding yeast cells from microscopic images. This is the
reproduction of yeast cells. I will show some code for this
project. Finally, I will talk about a project we work on together with
nuclear physics. The goal of this project is to process a lot of data
and filter the data. Through computer vision the right data should be
recognized. All scripts will be in Python.
