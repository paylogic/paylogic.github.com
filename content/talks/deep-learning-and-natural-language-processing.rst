:title: Deep learning and natural language processing

Like many fields in computer science, natural language processing
(NLP) has changed due to the ever increasing accuracy of deep learning
systems. During my graduation at Spindle I have focused my thesis on
NLP. In this talk I will show how grammar from a language used to be
captured, and how it is done by current approaches. The goal is to
provide attendees with some intuition about what is currently possible
and what is not.
