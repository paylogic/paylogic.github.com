:title: BayesicFitting. A Toolbox for Bayesian Model Fitting.

BayesicFitting is a collection of more than 100 python classes that
can be used to fit models to data. There are over 50 basic model
classes that can be combined in several ways to construct compound
models. And over 10 fitters that find least-squares or maximum
likelihoods. All fitters can calculate the evidence to discriminate
between models. The remainder are error distributions, priors and
engines to run NestedSampler, the Bayesian way to solve problems.  The
talk will be about the design of the package, the relations between
the classes with plenty of examples how to use it.  BayesicFitting is
available on GitHub and Pypi.
