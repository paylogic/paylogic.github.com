:title: Building smart Python apps on Google Cloud Platform

Python makes building apps that perform at scale easy. Google Cloud lets developers push the scale
even further, along with adding great deal of insight powered by Machine Learning. In this session
weâ€™re going to learn about:

- How we can run Python applications on Google Cloud, debug it and scale dynamically, accommodating the most demanding load scenarios
- Making our application smart and empowered with Machine Learning capabilities, such as:

  - Language translation
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Image content recognition

We'll build an app (code on screen, full code walkthrough, etc) that will:

- Be developed in Python (Django) - we'll show all SDKs and platform functions leveraged
- How to debug, log and monitor
- Run on Google App Engine and scale dynamically under load
- Leverage Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) for storage
- Tap on Machine Learning - use Translate API, Natural Language API and Vision API
