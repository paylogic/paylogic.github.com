:title: Find that üçå in 10 minutes using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning and computer vision in Python introduction. It is absolute beginner level, since the hardest part is making your test set, and not the Python plumbing.

After some background information about how computers can "see", and how they learn, I will give a demo of the application I have made, showing all the steps to take.
Using a set of positive and negative pictures and some manual cropping I will guide you through the process of making a test set that you can use to teach OpenCV to recognise certain objects.

It will also cover how you can start your learning cycle, but since it takes hours/days (depending on your machine) we will quickly skip to a pre-learned set I've made.
The result of the demo will be a Python application that can find and indicate where the bananas are using your MacBook's webcam.

Last but not least, the code is shared on GitHub. Since OpenCV is pretty hard to compile with the right flags I've included a Dockerfile.
