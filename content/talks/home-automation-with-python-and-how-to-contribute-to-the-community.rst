Have you ever contribute to a community? Are you ready for the next
step in home automation or afraid of using home automation? Get
informed how home-assistant can make you live easier and how you can
contribute to a community. In the first part of this talk Iâ€™m going to
talk about what home-assistant is, how you can run it quickly and
start hooking up things. In the second part of my talk I will talk
about how you can contribute to the communities.

Home-Assistant is completely written in Python3 and have a large
growing community. Thanks by the architecture is it very easy to add
custom components, that's why there are more than 1310 build in
components. You can hook up your ikea tradfri lights, your toon or
