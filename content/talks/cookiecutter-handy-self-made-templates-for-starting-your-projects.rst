:title: Cookiecutter: handy (self-made) templates for starting your projects

Cookiecutter (https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) is a handy program
to start your project with. You give it a template and it creates the
basic structure for your project. There are all sorts of templates
online, but you can also create your own. Especially useful inside a
company, to ensure projects look more or less the same and to help
colleagues get started right away with documentation, testing,
packaging, automation, etc.
