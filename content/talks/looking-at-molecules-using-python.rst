:title: Looking at molecules using Python
:fulltitle: Looking at molecules using Python

To understand our biology, we need to look at what happens at the molecular level. Except that we cannot "look" at such a small scale with a microscope; so we use computer simulations to study the motion of molecules at an atomic or near atomic resolution.

In this presentation, I will demonstrate how Python can be used throughout the workflow of molecular dynamic simulations. We will see how Python can be used to set up simulations, and how we can visualize simulations in a Jupyter Notebook with NGLView (http://arose.github.io/nglview/latest/). We will also see the MDAnalysis library (http://mdanalysis.org) to write analysis tools, and datreant (http://datreant.org/) to organize the data.

The use of Python is growing in all fields of academic research. This leads to a very rich ecosystem of libraries that becomes even richer every time a field communicates about its tools outside of its community. With this talk, I aim to illustrate the use of Python in a field that only rarely talks about its tools at Python conferences.
