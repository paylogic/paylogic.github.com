:title: What was its type?

Coming from Java and a bit of C, the switch to python was not always
easy. This was partly because python is a dynamically typed
language. With the introduction of type hinting it is possible for
developers to provide types for variables. This can help reduce the
amount of scope one needs to cope with, while also helping IDEs and
other code analysis tools to help you write code. However, in most of
the (open source) python code type hinting is not present. This talk
will be a short introduction in type hinting, to show its advantages
and hopefully make you consider using it sometime.
