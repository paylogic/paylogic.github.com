:title: Python as a scientist's playground

Python is the perfect tool for scientific programming since there are
SO MANY different modules with pre-packaged solutions available on
PyPI and conda-forge. However, there are SO MANY different modules
available, with many either providing the exact same solutions with a
different coating, or at least having overlapping functionality. This
can make it difficult to choose one package over another.

In my talk I will discuss some specific features I take into
consideration as a scientist when choosing one package over
another. As an example I will look at some packages providing
implementations for graphs, and why I chose one over the others. I
hope that from my talk you can learn what you can do to make your
package as useful as possible to me and help me choose your package.
