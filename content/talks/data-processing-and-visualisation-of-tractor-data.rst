:title: Data processing and visualisation of tractor data

Tractors are capable of logging a huge amount of data while
working. Things like position, fuel usage and yield are recorded
continuously. This data can be an invaluable source of information for
farmers about their crop fields. We'll discuss how we leverage tools
like postgis, numpy. pandas and matplotlib to process this data and
create different types of visualisations and provide usable feedback
to farmers to help them make decisions for more efficient and
effective farming.
