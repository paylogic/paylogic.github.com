:title: Deep learning with TensorFlow

I've been working with TensorFlow a lot lately and would like to show people why it's so cool. TensorFlow has a Python frontend and is popular among Python programmers and researchers. Since the focus of this PyGrunn edition is A.I., I thought I couldn't go wrong with Python + machine learning.

This talk will be a quick introduction to machine learning and deep learning in general, and will show how Google's TensorFlow library can be used to implement a simple neural network.
