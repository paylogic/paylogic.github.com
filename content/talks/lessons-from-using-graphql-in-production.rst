:title: Lessons from using GraphQL in production

In 2017, GraphQL was introduced to the PyGrunn community, we will
expand on that presentation with some lessons from using GraphQL in
production. We will touch some more advanced GraphQL features: Using
Fragments, how to combine this with uploading files, authentication,
and more. We will also have a quick demonstration and recap of GraphQL
and the pros and cons.
