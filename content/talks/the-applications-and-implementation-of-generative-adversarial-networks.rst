:title: The applications and implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are systems of two competing
artificial neural networks that can generate realistic artificial data
in a given domain. Since their introduction in 2014, they have mostly
been used to generate realistic looking images, but they can also be
applied in other domains like music, or fraud detection. In this talk,
I will focus on the inner workings of GANs, their different
applications, and how they can be implemented in Python.
