Django models give you a lot querying possibilities. But..... have you ever read the full documentation on .filter(), .values_list(), .prefetch_related() and .annotate()? I'll show you what you can do. This way you know whether something you want is possible and you can look it up in the documentation. I gave a similar talk on the django admin last year and I saw quite some "aha!" expressions among the listeners. You can do more with django models than you probably know. And you can do it faster.
