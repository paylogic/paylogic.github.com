:title: Automatic Monitoring and Profiling Flask-Based Services: The Easy Way

Web-services are becoming more and more used nowadays and many are
implemented using Flask, one of the main web-development frameworks
for Python. Most existing performance monitoring platforms are
heavyweight to configure and treat the subject code as a black box. We
present the Flask Monitoring Dashboard
(https://github.com/flask-dashboard), our open-source solution for
monitoring and profiling Flask-based web-services. It is trivial to
install and configure while providing a rich set of features.
