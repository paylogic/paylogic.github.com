:title: Researching Spotify's role in the music industry using Python 

In this talk I will briefly discuss one of the data science projects
from the University of Groningen where were I have used Python. In
this project we work together with the department of Journalism to
find out the role of Spotify as an intermediary in the music
industry. We used selenium to scrape the twitter account of
Spotify. We will show in a a short video how this is done. From the
tweets that we scraped we selected the links that were mentioned in
the tweets and parsed them. If either a playlists, albums, or song was
promoted in the tweet we scraped the whole page on spotify. This
resulted in a data frame that we analyzed using python, which gave
same interesting results of what spotify has done in the last few
years.
