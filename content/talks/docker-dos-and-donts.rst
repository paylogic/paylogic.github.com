:title: Docker do's and don'ts

At Dacom Farm Intelligence we use Docker for managing our Python/Django environments. I have come to realise that we are not always using Docker 'the right way'. I will show some examples and share some do's and don'ts. I expect no or little prior knowledge of Docker.

This talk is interesting for people who want to hear some experiences with Docker as a deployment technology.
