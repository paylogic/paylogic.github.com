:title: How you can use Python to charge your electric vehicle.

We are at the start of a new era of mobility: the combustion engine is
being replaced by batteries. The load of Electrical Vehicles (EV) in
the electrical grid introduces new challenges.

Andr√© and Auke will demonstrate how their company, The Mobility House,
uses Python 3.7 in smart charging applications. Their company uses
their open source implentation of the protocol OCPP to control
chargers while charging EVs.

They'll also show how you can control your charger using OCPP with
open source Python solutions.
