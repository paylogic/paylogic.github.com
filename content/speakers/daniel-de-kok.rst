I am a researcher at the University of Tübingen. My interest lies the analysis
of natural language using deep learning methods such as convolutional and
recurrent neural network. I am particularly interested in part-of-speech tagging,
topological field analysis, dependency parsing, and phrasal composition. I
primarily use Rust and Tensorflow, with some Python for gluing.
