Born and raised in Groningen. While following the Computing Science
program at the University, Guus got distracted by what life and
programming has to offer.  That is why he is still finishing up his
master in data science and systems complexity. This culminated in
organising the largest student conference about IT in the Netherlands
on disruptive technology. Furthermore, he is participating in
Ticketguard, a startup where they offer dynamic, non-resellable access
identifier for events, enterprises and public transport.
