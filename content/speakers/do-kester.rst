I have over 40 years of programming experience (fortran, pascal, C,
java, python) in the area of space based astronomy at SRON (Space
Research of the Netherlands). Mostly I was involved in the calibration
of instruments on board of satellites. Modelling is an integral part
of it.  From 2000 I developed a fitting package in JAVA for the
Herschel satellite of ESA. All my past fitting experiences and needs I
have tried to address in it. After my retirement in 2014 I have
rewritten this package into python. It became BayesicFitting.
