Marina Papadopoulou is a PhD student on Theoretical Biology at the
University of Groningen, where she studies computational models of
self-organization and complex collective behaviors of social
systems. She holds a Bachelor degree of Biology from the Aristotle
University of Thessaloniki and a Master of Science on Computational
Methods in Ecology and Evolution from Imperial College
London. Throughout her studies, she focused on the application of
computational tools on natural sciences research, from spatial
modelling of wild animal populations, to cultural evolution and birdsâ€™
collective escape. Marina is also involved in various side projects,
such as a documentary about sustainable agriculture and the
organization of the Groningen PhD Day 2019, and supports efforts of
promoting women in science and engineering. She mostly speaks in Greek
and English, and writes in C++, Python and R.
