I am a NodeJS and Python geek and Software Engineer.

As a child I started with dBase III and built games using C and x86 assembler. Later, I spent many years writing Java for banks, PHP payment processors to sell digital goods and subscriptions, and designing the architecture of distributed systems for event ticketing peak sales, after which I moved to the center of Europe for the challenging fun of NodeJS, CouchDB and mobile event technology. And now I am back in the Netherlands!

When I’m not coding or designing software I am biking around the Netherlands on my recumbent bike, working on a my short story collections, or figuring out how to get music out of my EWI.

I love to give talks and share knowledge.
