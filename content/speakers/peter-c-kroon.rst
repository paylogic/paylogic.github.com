I'm a PhD student at the university of Groningen working on Molecular
Dynamics. Most of the time however, I'm busy creating new tools and
research possibilities using Python rather than doing what I was hired
to do. Science presents its own unique set of programming challenges,
some of which I encounter every day. I hope to highlight a few of
those in my talk.
