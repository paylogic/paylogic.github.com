I have been interested in programming since high school. After receiving my master in Computer Science I have worked as a software developer for a number of companies. At those companies I have developed software in different programming languages, including C#, Java, JavaScript and of course Python. I have used Python a lot during the last five or so years of my career, mostly to build web applications. I am co-founder and lead developer at the independent career platform "Profileermij" where I currently work. My responsibilities include the development of the Profileermij back-end which is a Python web application built using Flask, SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL.
